The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance. Sensor data is made available on the website. Flask API is used to create RESTFUL API. The sensor output is made available on the GET request. The actual project deals with 4mA to 20mA sensor current output which is to be converted to digital form using ADC. This is a small prototype done using an UltraSonic sensor.
